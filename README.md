## Zipping around

The most basic feature of this mod is the conductive floors(known as copper floors) that allowed faster movement. For best speed movement bonus, equip yourself with a hoverboard.

You can also move around the base automatically if you have accelerators to charge your hoverboard, directives to direct your movement, and conductive floors to serve as pathways throughout your base.
