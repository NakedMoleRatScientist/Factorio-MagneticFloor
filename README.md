## Introduction

MagneticFloor is a mod that adds a totally new gameplay element, allowing for automation of player movements (and vehicles in the future), based on the conceit of using magnetic levitation to float.

The foundation of Magnetic Floor are the floor tiles known as copper-floor, which gives better bonus than concrete for speed movement bonus. Each successive tier(Level 1: ![Copper Floor](graphics/icons/copper-floor-icon.png) , Level 2: ![Copper Floor Level2](graphics/icons/copper-floor-icon_level2.png) , Level 3: ![Copper Floor Level3](graphics/icons/copper-floor-icon_level3.png)  ) of copper floors give better bonus movement. These are the critical pathways for automation of players movements.

To actually move player automatically required a multiple of requisites, some of which required technology research. Copper floor required green and red science.

First, ensure that a hoverboard ![hoverboard](graphics/icons/hoverboard-icon.png) is equipped with your power armor and that you are wearing it. If you are doing it correctly, the hoverboard UI ![hoverboard_ui](graphics/examples/hoverboard-ui.png), should appears somewhere on the upper left corner. If not, then you did not correctly equip the hoverboard.

If the hoverboard status indicated inactive, click on the button to turn on active navigation. Otherwise, it is off, disallowing any possibility of automated movement.

To start with, your hoverboard has a charge of zero, meaning that it will not move you. If you do have a charge, it will tick down to zero every tick, or that you are no longer on any conductive flooring.

You must place an accelerator to charge your hoverboard. This will give you an additional twenty charges.

Use directive tiles to direct the movement of your hoverboard.
