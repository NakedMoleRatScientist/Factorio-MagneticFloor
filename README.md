## Zipping around

Coupled with a conductive floor and some magnetism SCIENCE!, you too could zip around in a hoverboard, back to the future style.

Build conductive floor and it will be slightly faster than walking on concrete. However, to get the full benefit, build the hoverboard and equip it in your armor for even faster movement.

With directives, you can zip around the base automatically.
