## Introduction

MagneticFloor is a mod that adds a totally new gameplay element, allowing for automation of player movements (and vehicles in the future), based on the conceit of using magnetic levitation to float.

The foundation of Magnetic Floor are the floor tiles known as copper-floor, which gives better bonus than concrete for speed movement bonus. Each successive tier(Level 1: ![Copper Floor](graphics/icons/copper-floor-icon.png) , Level 2: ![Copper Floor Level2](graphics/icons/copper-floor-icon_level2.png) , Level 3: ![Copper Floor Level3](graphics/icons/copper-floor-icon_level3.png)  ) of copper floors give better bonus movement. These are the critical pathways for automation of players movements.

To actually move player automatically required a multiple of requisites, some of which required technology research. All tiers copper floor required green and red science, but unlocking the directives and the accelerator required blue science.

First, ensure that the equipment hoverboard ![hoverboard](graphics/icons/hoverboard-icon.png) is equipped in your power armor and that you are wearing it. If you are doing it correctly, the hoverboard UI ![hoverboard_ui](graphics/examples/hoverboard-ui.png), should appears somewhere around the upper left corner. If not, then you did not correctly equip the hoverboard.

If the button is indicated 'OFF', then you'll need to click on the button to turn on activate navigation. Otherwise, you will not be able to do any automated movements.

Next, you'll need to lay a path of copper flooring from your intended starting location to your intended destination.

The last component for automated movement is the directives and the accelerator tile. You'll need to supply electricity to your accelerator in order for the tile to work. The purpose of an accelerator is to charge your hoverboard, providing the energy it needs for automated movement for five seconds, or five ticks. Directives will supply your hoverboard with changes in the direction. Up, down, left, right arrows are what it is said on the tin.
