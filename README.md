## Zipping around

The most basic feature of this mod is the conductive floors(known as copper floors) that allowed faster movement. For best speed movement bonus, equip yourself with a hoverboard.

You can also move around the base automatically if you have accelerators to charge your hoverboard, directives to direct your movement, and conductive floors to serve as pathways throughout your base.

**To turn on active navigation** - If the hoverboard status is inactive, click on the button to turn it active. This will allow active navigation.

Make sure that you are equipped with a hoverboard in your armor's module inventory.

To start with, your hoverboard has a charge of zero, meaning that it will not move you. If you do have a charge, it will tick down to zero every tick, or that you are no longer on any conductive flooring.

You must place an accelerator ![Accelerator](/graphics/direcives/Accelerator.png) to charge your hoverboard. This will give you an additional twenty charges.

Use directive tiles to direct the movement of your hoverboard.
